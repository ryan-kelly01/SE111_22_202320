        <h1>Ryan Kelly</h1>

        <p>  Hello, I am Ryan, I am 21 years old from a small town in Vermont I moved to VT when I was in middle school.
            I am originally from Georgia and still visit during the summers to see old friends, I was raised playing basketball 
        and listening to rap music which is the basic lifestyle of the place im from. Moving to VT was a culture shock for the first
    few years but I got used to it and will call my house in VT my home. I enjoy computers which is why I went down this path and I 
    hope to learn lots and get a great job. </p>
